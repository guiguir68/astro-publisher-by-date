## Project Origin

The inspiration behind this project stems from my desire to write articles in advance for my Astro-powered blog, while keeping them from being published immediately. I aimed to establish an automated system centered around article dates, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

## How it works

During the generation of the static pages, the plugin checks the "pubDate" field within the Markdown pages. If the date is earlier than or equal to the current date, the module facilitates the page generation process. This ensures that pages are generated and published automatically based on their specified publication date.

## Installation

You can install the module with yarn:

```bash
yarn add astro-publisher-by-date
```

Then, in your `astro.config.mjs`, add the configuration bellow:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import publisherByDate from "astro-publisher-by-date";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    publisherByDate()
    ],
});

```
